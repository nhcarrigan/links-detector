            const body = `Hey there~! This is the checklist that @naomi-lgbt follows when she sets up a repository from this template. We thought it might be helpful for you too.

            - [ ] Update the repository about.
              - [ ] Update the description.
              - [ ] Update the website, when live.
              - [ ] Update the topics (add \`hacktoberfest\` if applicable).
              - [ ] Do not include packages or environments (unless deploying on GitHub Pages).
              - [ ] Do not include the releases if you aren't going to keep up with SemVer.
            - [ ] Update the repository settings.
              - [ ] Disable the wiki.
              - [ ] Disable the projects.
              - [ ] Disallow merge commits.
              - [ ] Disallow rebase merging.
              - [ ] Automatically delete head branches
            - [ ] Create branch protection rule.
              - [ ] Require pull request reviews before merging.
                - [ ] Require approvals - 1.
                - [ ] Dismiss stale pull request approvals when new commits are pushed.
              - [ ] Require status checks to pass before merging.
                - [ ] Require branches to be up to date before merging.
                - [ ] Status checks:
                  - [ ] Analyse
                  - [ ] Lint / Build / Test
                  - [ ] Validate Dependencies are Pinned
            - [ ] Grant actions read/write permissions (the PR labeller will not work without this).
            - [ ] [Migrate Labels](https://naomi.lgbt/notes/#/transfer-labels).
            - [ ] If not under an organisation, add the monitor webhook.
            - [ ] Update the \`README.md\` file to remove the existing text and use the commented-out template.
            - [ ] Delete the \`init.yml\` workflow (which triggered this issue).
